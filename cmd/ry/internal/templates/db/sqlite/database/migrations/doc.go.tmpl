// Package migrations holds this application's schema migrations.
//
// Each migration is a file that registers itself from init, so importing this
// package is enough to make every migration known to the runner:
//
//	func init() {
//	    migrate.Register("20260101000000_create_users", up, down)
//	}
//
// Create one with:
//
//	ry make:migration create_users
//
// This package lives in the database overlay rather than the base skeleton
// because migrations are a SQL idea. The three that ship here create the tables
// the framework's own database-backed session, queue and cache drivers expect,
// so any SQL overlay has to carry an equivalent set; the MongoDB overlay
// carries none at all, and declares indexes from the models instead.
